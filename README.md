# WordSearch
A C program that will search for words in five directions (left to right, right to left, top to bottom, top left to bottom, and top right to bottom left) by two given text files ( 1. puzzle grid and  2. list of words from a text file). Once a word has been found, the program will convert the word into lowercase without any use of build in functions that comes with C.
